# Inline vs Block Elements in HTML

HTML elements are mainly divided into:

- Block elements
- Inline elements

---

# 🟥 1️⃣ Block Elements

## ✅ What They Do

- Take **full width** of the page (100%)
- Always start on a **new line**
- Stack vertically (one below another)

---

## 📌 Example

```html
<div>Hello</div>
<div>World</div>
```

### Output:

```
Hello
World
```

Even if there is space available, block elements move to the next line.

---

## ⭐ Common Block Elements

- `<div>`
- `<p>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- `<section>`
- `<article>`
- `<ul>`
- `<ol>`
- `<li>`
- `<form>`

---

## 🧠 Think Like This

Block element = 📦 Big box  
It occupies the whole row.

---

# 🟦 2️⃣ Inline Elements

## ✅ What They Do

- Take only the **width they need**
- Do **NOT** start on a new line
- Sit next to each other

---

## 📌 Example

```html
<span>Hello</span>
<span>World</span>
```

### Output:

```
Hello World
```

They stay on the same line.

## ⭐ Common Inline Elements

- `<span>`
- `<a>`
- `<img>`
- `<strong>`
- `<em>`
- `<label>`
